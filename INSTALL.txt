Upon installation this should include various files including the folder lib 
and testing, which contains most of the source code we have written and
folder with our unit tests respectively, and general other documents such as 
dune files and the Makefile . 

In order to use current version make sure to install the following 
dependencies:

cohttp-lwt-unix
dotenv
opium
safepass
sqlite3 
odoc
ssl
tls

NOTE: Packages with system dependencies may prompt further installations that 
must also be installed

Once these dependencies are installed, you can run the command make build to 
have all the files compile. 

Afterward, you can run the make test command to execute the OUnit test suite. 
In addition, you can also run make docs to extract the HTML documentation for
our compilation units.

You may run make script to preload some data into our database, and then you 
can run make app to run the system on localhost. 

We use the app Postman to model changes (making get/post requests to 
various routes) and DB Browser for SQLite to have a visualization for everytime
we make updates for our tables including insertions and deletions for all 
our tables -- users, friends, group_invites, groups, visited etc.
