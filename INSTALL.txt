Upon installation this should include an interface and implementation for a 
group, user, restaurant. Other scripts are either helpers or include json
files to test the functionality of our scripts (not all json files have
been used for testing as of 10-24-20).

In order to use current version make sure to first run "make build" in terminal 
(in the 3110Project folder) to compile all necessary files. After run 
"make script" to test any functionality that would involve changing
information from a json and adding it to a group.
