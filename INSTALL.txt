Upon installation this should include various files including the folder lib and testing, 
which contains most of the source code we have written and
folder with our unit tests respectively, and general other documents such as dune files 
and the Makefile . 

In order to use current version make sure to install the following dependencies:
 to first run "dune build main.exe" in 
terminal (in the 3110Project folder) to compile all necessary files. If 
dependencies are required, please install them with OPAM. After that 
run "dune exec ./main.exe" to run a server on localhost to use any functionality 
that would involve creating/getting users, groups, restrictions, and friends. 
We use the app Postman to model these changes (making get/post requests to 
various routes) and DB Browser for SQLite to browse the database we have 
created.
